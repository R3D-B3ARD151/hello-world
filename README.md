# hello-world
Just getting started
My name is Dustin. I am a veteran that has been a diesel mechanic for the 
last 8 years and have decided to make a career change. I am new to the computer 
industry and it seems a bit overwhelming at times going from turning wrenches to 
writing code but I am excited to begin expanding my understanding of computers and
the industry.
